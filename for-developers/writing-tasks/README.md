# Writing tasks

Now that you have used `secator` for a while, you might regret that the scripts or CLI tools you use daily are not supported yet. No panic,  just follow the guides to integrate them yourself !

To get started:

* Read [integrating-an-external-command](integrating-an-external-command/ "mention") if you plan on integrating a new external command.
* Read [integrate-custom-python-code-wip.md](integrate-custom-python-code-wip.md "mention") if you plan on integrating embedded Python code.
